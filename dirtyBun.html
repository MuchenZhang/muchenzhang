    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;"><h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <p>Dough</p>
      <li>flour 250g</li>
      <li>cocoa powder 10g</li>
      <li>cold milk 150mL</li>
      <li>yeast 3g</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>salt 1 tsp</li>
      <li>sugar 1tbsp</li>
      <li>softened butter 10g</li>
      <p>Chocolate Ganache</p>
      <li>100g dark chocolate</li>
      <li>150g heavy cream</li>
      <li>some cocoa powder for the top</li>
    </ul>
  </div><br>

  <div id="process">
    <ol><h4>Process</h4>
      <li>Mix up all ingredients except for butter and knead until smooth. </li>
      <li>Add in butter and knead. The dough should preferably pass the windowpane test.</li>
      <li>Once the dough is nice and smooth, cover and rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Put about 100g of cold butter in a plastic bag or a piece of parchment paper. </li>
      <li>Roll out the butter into a rectangle and freeze for 20 minutes. </li>
      <li>Once the butter is cold and hard again, take the dough out and roll it out into a rectangle 1.5 times the size of the butter. </li>
      <li>Place the butter in the center of the dough and close the dough up. We are making a pastry now, it is the same as making a croissant. </li>
      <li>Put the closed dough in the freezer for another 20 minutes. </li>
      <li>Repeat these two steps for another three times.</li>
      <li>Take out the dough and roll it out to a bigger, thinner sheet. </li>
      <li>Divide the dough into stripes</li>
      <li>Place a piece of chocolate at the beginning and roll.</li>
      <li>Once the individual little buns are rolled up, cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 hour.</li>
      <li>Bake in preheated oven at 180&#8451 for 20 minutes. We are going to make chocolate ganache. </li>
      <li>Add the chocolate and heavy cream in a bowl and microwave in 30 sec intervals. Stir after each interval.</li>
      <li>Let the ganache cool a little and dip the top of the bun in it.</li>
      <li>Sift some cocoa powder on top and you got a calorie bomb. </li>
    </ol>

    <ol><h4>Things to read before you start making this recipe</h4>
      <p>Remember to rest the buns at a cool temperature before baking since butter WILL melt at 305K. </p>
