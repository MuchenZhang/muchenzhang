      <li>2 sticks of green onion</li>
      <li>2g of salt</li>
      <li>3g oil</li>
      <li>COLD unsalted butter, 60g</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>

    <ol><h4>Process</h4>
      <li>Preheat oven to 205&#8451.</li>
      <li>Chop green onions into fine bits, add in salt and oil and set it aside</li>
      <li>Chop the butter into cubes that are the size of a pea, we don't want melted or creamed butter. You can
      also pulse the butter with the flour in a food processor.</li>
      <li>Mix up the butter, flour, and baking powder. Do not melt the butter.</li>
      <li>Add in the egg and milk/water.</li>
      <li>Add the green onion in last.</li>
      <li>Shape the dough into balls and place them on a baking tray. You don't need to space them out, they will not expand horizontally
      or vertically.</li>
      <li>Bake at 205&#8451 for about 22 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

  <div id="reminder">
    <ol><h4>Things to read before you start making this recipe</h4>
      <p>The butter in this recipe creates tiny holes in the biscuit and makes it flaky. So make sure that all the ingredients are
      cold.</p>
      <p>Do not overmix after adding in the wet ingredients. You have to be quick when shaping the biscuits and placing them on
      a baking tray, you don't want the dough to sit for a long time or gluten will form and the biscuits won't be as flaky.</p>
    </ol>
