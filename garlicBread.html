    <ol><h4>Things to read before you start making this recipe</h4>
      <p>Don't worry if you don't have a 6-inch mold, I'll teach you how to make one using aluminium foil and cardboards.
      (I made this bread using my homemade mold and it turned out great) First, cut out two 25 by 10 cm rectangles from
      a cereal box. Then wrap a piece of aluminium foil around them. Next, staple the sides and you have a mold! However,
      the baking time might change a little since foil is not a great heat conductor. Do the second prove inside the
      mold and bake with the mold for about 10 minutes. Then take off the mold and bake for another 20 to 25 minutes or
      until golden brown. </p>
