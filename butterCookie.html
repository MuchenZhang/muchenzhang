      <li>Press it into a dough and refrigerate it for 30 minutes.</li>

  <div id="reminder">
    <ol><h4>Things to read before you start making this recipe</h4>
      <p>You can make them into chocolate or matcha flavored cookies by adding 7g of cocoa powder or matcha powder into the dough.</p>
      <p>You can decorate this cookie by creating imprints on them with a cookie stamp. I tried creating some patterns using the sides
       of a whiskey glass but it didn't show on the cookies once they came out of the oven. You can freeze the dough before making
     imprints so the dough hardens up and makes the pattern show. </p>
