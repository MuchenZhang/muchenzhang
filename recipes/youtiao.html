      <li>Flour 350g</li>
      <li>Water 250g</li>
      <li>Baking powder 10g</li>
      <li>Baking soda 3g</li>
      <li>Salt 6g</li>
      <li>Oil 12g</li>

    <ol><h4>Process</h4>
      <li>Mix all the ingredients and form a dough. Knead the dough until smooth and refrigerate overnight.</li>
      <li>Roll the dough out to a rectangle around 7cm wide and 1cm thick.</li>
      <li>Cover and rest the dough for 15 minutes if the dough tightens up when rolling.</li>
      <li>Cut the rectangle to strips that are around 3cm wide. You will have little 3*7cm strips.</li>
      <li>Lay one strip onto another and make an indentation with a chopstick in the center along the long side.
      The stip will have a mark across its "body".</li>
      <li>Gently pinch down the top and bottom of the strip, making the two strips stick to each other.</li>
      <li>Heat up a pot of oil to around 180 to 200&#8451 and fry them up.</li>
      <li>People usually eat youtiaos with soy milk.</li>
      <li>I found this image from <i>omnivorescookbook</i> that will help explain the shaping process</li>

    <ol><h4>Things to read before you start making this recipe</h4>
      <p>This is a traditional chinese breakfast. I know they are fried and unhealthy and what not, but they taste really amazing.</p>
      <p>You can also substitute water with cold milk when mixing the ingredients.</p>
      <p>When rolling out the dough, try to make it too thin, the ideal thickness should be around 1cm (the dough will puff up better)</p>
