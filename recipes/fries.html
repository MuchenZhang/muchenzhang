    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;"><h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <li>2 potatoes, peeled</li>
      <li>Frying oil</li>
      <li>A pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
  </div><br>

  <div id="process">
    <ol><h4>Process</h4>
      <li>Peel and chop the potatoes into strips. </li>
      <li>Soak the potato strips in water to wash off the starch. </li>
      <li>In a pan, add in soaked potato and oil (enough to cover the top of the potatoes).</li>
      <li>Turn on the stove to medium high heat.</li>
      <li>Once bubbles form in the pan, switch to medium heat.</li>
      <li>Leave the potatoes to fry and DO NOT stir them, they are soft and fragile at this stage.</li>
      <li>Stir them a bit when you see some browning parts and they are starting to crisp up. It'll take about 20
      minutes from start to this stage.</li>
      <li>Fry them for a bit longer for a crispier and darker skin. </li>
      <li>Sprinkle on some salt as soon as they come out of the pan. </li>
    </ol>

  <div id="reminder">
    <ol><h4>Things to read before you start making this recipe</h4>
      <p>This is the easiest way to make french fries on the Internet and it tastes just as good. 
      It's kind of like boiling the fries in oil instead of frying them. Other recipes I read require
      frying the potatoes twice, once in a lower temperature, and once in a high temperature. </p>
      <p>I'll try to make some sweet potato fries next time, hope it works.</p>
