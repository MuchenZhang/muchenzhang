      <li>You would score the bread at this step.</li>
      <li>Take out the dutch oven and transfer the dough inside. CAUTION, it is very hot.</li>

    <ol><h4>Things to read before you start making this recipe</h4>
      <p>Be very CAREFUL when dealing with the dutch oven, I burnt a piece of my skin on the arm when taking it out.</p>
      <p>You don't have to knead the dough at all! All the steps can be done in one bowl.</p>
