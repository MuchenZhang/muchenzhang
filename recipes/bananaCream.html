    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;"><h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <li>100g sugar</li>
      <li>50g cornstarch or potato starch</li>
      <li>some salt</li>
      <li>3 egg yolks</li>
      <li>600mL whole milk</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp butter</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla (optional)</li>
      <li>2-3 bananas</li>
      <li>crackers and butter for the crust</li>
      <li>whipped cream for decoration</li>
    </ul>
  </div><br>

  <div id="process">
    <ol><h4>Process</h4>
      <p><b>To make the crust:</b></p>
      <li>Put some crackers into a food processor and process it until fine crumbs. Or you can smash it with a hammer if you don't have a food processor</li>
      <li>Add in about 50g of melted butter, the texture should be like wet sand</li>
      <li>press the crumbs into a mold</li>
      <li>You can bake it at 180 &#8451 for 10 minutes or just chill it in the fridge</li>
      <p><b>To make the custard:</b></p>
      <li>Mix up 3 egg yolks, sugar, about 50mL of milk, and starch in a bowl</li>
      <li>Pour the remaining milk into a saucepan and let it simmer over medium heat</li>
      <li>Once the milk is simmering, pour it into the egg mixture and whisk vigorously (You don't want scrambled eggs)</li>
      <li>Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and whisk over medium heat</li>
      <li>It should thicken after about 10 minutes, turn the heat off and add in the butter and vanilla extract</li>
      <li>Keep whisking the mixture until the butter melts</li>
      <li>Place a plastic wrap on the custard, directly touching the top of the mixture (prevent a skin from forming) and chill it in the fridge</li>
      <p><b>Assemble!</b></p>
      <p>I put two layers of bananas, two layers of custard, and whipped cream on top for my pie. But you can change it up and add any
      fillings in between. If you put the custard on the bottom and some fruits on top, congratulations, you've just made a fruit tart!</p>
      <p>Chill the pie overnight before serving so the custard can hold its shape</p>

    </ol>

    <ol><h4>Things to read before you start making this recipe</h4>
      <p>There's a ton of whisking in this recipe but the hard work always pays off. And there are also many variations to this recipe,
      you can substitute coconut milk for milk and get a coconut cream pie, or layer strawberries instead of bananas. Have fun
    experimenting with different ingredients!</p>
