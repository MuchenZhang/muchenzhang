    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;"><h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <li>5 eggs</li>
      <li>Flour 70g</li>
      <li>Oil 60mL</li>
      <li>Water 50mL</li>
      <li>Sugar 70g</li>

    <ol><h4>Process</h4>
      <li>Separate the eggs into yolks and whites.</li>
      <li>Heat up oil to about 70&#8451, that's around 90 seconds in the microwave.</li>
      <li>Add the hot oil into sifted flour and mix.</li>
      <li>Add some water to cool down the temperature of the mixture.</li>
      <li>Gradually add all the yolks into the mixture and set aside.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 140&#8451.</li>
      <li>Beat the egg whites until soft peak. Gradually add in sugar during this process.</li>
      <li>Fold 1/3 of the beated egg whites into the yolk mixture until homogenous.</li>
      <li>Gently fold in the rest of the egg whites.</li>
      <li>Pour the final mixture into a cake mold. You can line some parchment paper under so you can pull out the
      cake as soon as it gets out the oven. </li>
      <li>Wrap the mold in foil if you are using one with a removable bottom.</li>
      <li>Place the mold on a tray filled half-way with room-temp water.</li>
      <li>Bake at 140&#8451 for one hour.</li>
      <li>Turn the temperature up to 150&#8451 for another 10 minutes for a darker color on top.</li>
      <li>Take it out of the oven and remove the cake out of the mold ASAP. Peel off the parchment paper too.</li>
      <li>Enjoy.</li>
    </ol>

  <div id="reminder">
    <ol><h4>Things to read before you start making this recipe</h4>
      <p>Be gentle when folding the two mixtures.</p>
      <p>You can also use a non-stick mold, just make sure to get the cake out asap.</p>
      <p>I used a 9-inch mold and I think the cake turn out a bit too flat. Maybe switch out for a 6-inch mold.</p>
