    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;"><h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <li>Flour 500g</li>
      <li>Yeast 4g</li>
      <li>Water 290g</li>
      <li>Scallions, chopped</li>
      <li>Oil 20g</li>
      <li>Some salt</li>
    </ul>

    <ol><h4>Process</h4>
      <li>Mix the first three ingredients to a dough. Rest the dough for 10 minutes and knead until smooth.</li>
      <li>Oil the bowl. Cover and proof for 1 hour.</li>
      <li>Take out the dough and deflate it. Roll the dough out to a rectangle that is not too thin. </li>
      <li>Spread the scallion-oil-salt mixture evenly on top of the rectangle.</li>
      <li>Fold the rectangle in thirds lengthwise, press the dough gently between folds to deflate the air. You should get
      a thin rectangle with the same length, but 1/3 of the width. </li>
      <li>Cut strips that are about 2cm wide along the length of the thin rectangle.</li>
      <li>Take two strips, lay one on top of the other and press in the middle with a chopstick.</li>
      <li>Gently stretch the strip longer and flip it up-side-down (so the side that's pressed by the chopstick is on
        the table). </li>
      <li>Place a chopstick in the middle of the long strip and fold the strip in half.</li>
      <li>Tightly pinch the endpoint and twist the chopstick twice.</li>
      <li>Press the chopstick down and take it out. You will get a twisted roll.</li>
      <li>Put it on a steam cooker/bamboo steamer and place it on top of a pot of COLD water. Don't forget to oil the
      surface of the cooker so the rolls won't stick</li>
      <li>Steam for 15 minutes when the water starts to boil and you can see steam coming out.</li>
      <li>After 15 minutes, turn off the heat, but DO NOT OPEN THE LID. The rolls will deflate if you open it immediately.</li>
    </ol>

  <div id="reminder">
    <ol><h4>Things to read before you start making this recipe</h4>
      <p>Leave room for the rolls to grow when you put them in the cooker. </p>
      <p>The scallion is optional. If you want to make the rolls in its original flavor, spread some oil instead of the
      scallion mixture in step 4</p>
      <p>Here is a video for shaping the rolls.</p>
