    <ol><h4>Things to read before you start making this recipe</h4>
      <p>There are so many variations to this recipe. You can substitute the coconut oil for butter or vegetable oil. Just remember to put
      some fat in there. If you want a healthier version of this recipe, simply replace flour with almond flour or coconut flour. </p>
      <p>You can always cut or add 30% of the sugar in this recipe, depending on how sweet you want it to be. And do not worry if you don't have
       brown sugar, putting only granulated sugar will also work, the cookie will just be crispier.</p>
      <p>There are two types of people when it comes to cookies, the crispy people and the chewy people. Personally, I like a crispier cookie,
       but you can also add more brown sugar to make it more chewy.</P>
      <p>You can put either dark chocolate or mild chocolate into your cookie. I prefer darker chocolate just because it balances
      the sweetness from all those sugar. But whatever works for you. </p>
