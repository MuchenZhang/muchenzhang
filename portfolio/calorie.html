    <p>This web app allows the user to add breakfast, lunch, and dinner dishes
     and stores them in a database. When the user wants to select a meal they had, the dropdown menu will display all dishes
    added to the database previously. After selecting what he or she ate during the day, the user can then see if his or her calorie
  intake is above or below the goal they set. In the end, the web app will show a graph of the user's weight over time to assist
his or her journey of living a healthier life. </p>
