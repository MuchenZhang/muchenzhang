    <p>This is a story of Billy, a farmer who has worked his way up to a rich guy in London. As he became wealthier, his body became bulkier and heavier.
    It is funny that his body will eventually get stuck between small gaps. Collision detection doesn't work for him :))</p>
    <p>The video below illustrates the first time Billy came to London, he was excited about the city and wished to become
    part of it in the future.</p>
